2.  IMPORTANCE OF ACCESSIBLE WEBSITES:-

Great websites aren’t just beautiful and informative. They’re also easy to navigate and accessible for all visitors to find what they want. When you build a website for a client, one of your goals should be to help them reach the broadest audience possible. By designing with web accessibility in mind, people with different needs and preferences can engage with your client’s website and learn more about their brand.

Accessible websites are more inclusive. They use fonts and colors that are easy to read. Accessible websites are structured with contextual tags and elements, so webpages translate clearly on different devices. They also feature images with descriptive alt text, so people using assistive technology can appreciate and access the full range of content on the site. 

By adhering to web accessibility best practices, your client’s website will be a welcoming place for every customer to visit. You can also enjoy additional benefits, like improved SEO performance and higher order completion.
